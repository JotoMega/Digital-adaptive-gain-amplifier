# Digital-adaptive-gain-amplifier
Smaller project for the Microcontroller Computer Systems class on the 3rd year of Bachelor Studies, developed on MSP430 development board. Repository inlcudes source code for the Digital adaptive gain amplifier which goal is to keep the amplitude of the output signal constant, no matter the strengt of the input signal, using simple gain adaptation.
